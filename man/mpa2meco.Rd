\usage{
mpa2meco(
  feature_table,
  sample_table = NULL,

  use_level = "s__",
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{feature_table}{'mpa' format abundance table, see the example.}

\item{sample_table}{default NULL; sample metadata table; If provided, must be one of the several types of formats: 
1) comma seperated file with the suffix csv or tab seperated file with suffix tsv/txt; 
2) Excel type file with the suffix xlsx or xls; require \code{readxl} package to be installed; 
3) \code{data.frame} object from R.}

\item{match_table}{default NULL; a two column table used to replace the sample names in abundance table; Must be two columns without column names;
The first column must be raw sample names same with those in feature table, 
the second column must be new sample names same with the rownames in sample_table; Please also see the example files.}

\item{use_level}{default "s__"; the prefix parsed for the otu_table and tax_table; must be one of 'd__', 'k__', 'p__', 'c__', 'o__', 'f__', 'g__' and 's__'.}

\item{...}{parameter passed to microtable$new function of microeco package, such as auto_tidy parameter.}

\value{
microtable object.

\description{
Transform the classification results of mpa (MetaPhlAn) format to microtable object,
such as MetaPhlAn and Kraken2 results. Kraken2 results can be obtained by merge_metaphlan_tables.py from MetaPhlAn or 
combine_mpa.py from KrakenTools (https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/krakentools/).
The algorithm of Kraken2 determines that the abundance of a taxon is not equal to the sum of abundances of taxa in its subordinate lineage.
So the default tables in taxa_abund of return microtable object are extracted from the abundances of raw file. 
It is totally different with the return taxa_abund of cal_abund function, 
which sums the abundances of taxa at different taxonomic levels based on the taxonomic table and the otu_table 
(i.e., taxa abundance table at a specified level, e.g., 's__').
